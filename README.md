## :mega: Prerequisites

You can choose between two options to run the workshop exercises:
* [Option A: GitHub Codespace](#option-a-github-codespace) (Using a Browser or VS Code - CodeQL is run remotely on a Linux based GitHub Codespace in the cloud)
* [Option B: Local installation](#option-b-local-installation) (Using VS Code - CodeQL is run locally on your machine)

### Option A: GitHub Codespace

Use a remote GitHub Codespace to work on the workshop exercises.

#### Prerequisites

* GitHub account ([sign up](https://github.com/) for free)
* Browser (you can do the whole workshop in a browser - this is the fastest setup) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (VS Code) with the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension installed on your local machine.

Note: The first 120 hours per core of Codespace usage are free per month, we use a codespace with 4 cores for this workshop since 4 cores is the current maximum for free accounts. (If you have a Pro account, we recommend switching to an 8-core machine.)

#### Instructions

1. Login to your [GitHub](https://github.com/login) account
2. Go to the repo https://github.com/sylwia-budzynska/2025-soss-codeql-workshop / (short link: https://gh.io/soss-codeql)
3. Click on Code -> Codespaces
4. Click on the plus sign (+) to create a new codespace.

<img src="images/create-codespace.png"  width="439" alt="Screenshot: Create Codespace, click on plus">

VS Code will start in your browser and a remote Codespace will be built. This may take a few minutes.
If you are asked to open the workspace `vscode-codeql-starter.code-workspace` click on "Open Workspace".

5. If you want to use VS Code locally, press the three lines button in the top left corner and select "Open VS Code Desktop". The option might take up to a few minutes to appear.

<img src="images/open-vscode-desktop.png" width="300" alt="Screenshot: Press the three lines button and Open in VS Code Desktop">

6. Continue with [Selecting a CodeQL Database](#select-codeql-database)
7. Then [Test your installation](#test-your-installation)

You can see your codespaces on at [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces).

### Option B: Local installation

Use a local CodeQL installation to work on the workshop exercises.

#### Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (VS Code) and `git` installed on your local machine.

#### Instructions

1. Install [VS Code extension for CodeQL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-codeql)
2. Run in the terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sylwia-budzynska/2025-soss-codeql-workshop
cd 2025-soss-codeql-workshop
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```
3. In VS Code: File -> **Open Workspace from File...** `vscode-codeql-starter.code-workspace`
4. Continue with [Selecting a CodeQL Database](#select-codeql-database)
5. Then [Test your installation](#test-your-installation)

#### Troubleshooting the local installation

In case you see errors such as:
* `Failed to run query: Could not resolve library path for [..]`
* `Could not resolve module [..]`
* `Could not resolve type [..]`

It is very likely that you missed cloning the git submodules (namely the ql repo). To fix this run `git submodule init && git submodule update --recursive`.

### Select CodeQL Database

1. Make sure you have the workspace `vscode-codeql-starter.code-workspace` open in VS Code.
2. Go To the CodeQL View
3. Click on "Choose Database from Archive" and select the `test-app-db.zip` file in the root of the repository.

### Test your installation

#### Prerequisites

Make sure that the previously chosen CodeQL database is selected in the CodeQL view. (Click on "Select" if it's not)

When the database is selected it should look like this (note the checkmark):

<img src="images/codeql-db-selected.png"  alt="Screenshot: CodeQL Database selected">

#### Instructions

1. In VS Code: go to the workspace folder: `codeql-custom-queries-python`
2. Create a new file `test.ql`
3. add the following content: `select "Hello World!"`
4. Save file, right click in the file area and choose "CodeQL: Run Query on Selected Database"
5. You should see a new tab open with the result "Hello World!"

## Workshop

Welcome to the workshop "Finding vunlnerabilities with CodeQL"!

This session will introduce fundamentals of security research and static analysis used when looking for vulnerabilities in software. We will use an example of a simple vulnerability, walk through how CodeQL could detect it, and provide examples on how the audience could use CodeQL to find vulnerabilities themselves.

Before we get started it is important that all of the prerequisites are met so you can participate in the workshop.

The workshop is divided into multiple sections and each section consists of exercises that build up to the final query.
For each section we provide *guidelines* that help you finish the exercise by providing you with references to QL classes and member predicates that you can use.

### Overview

In this workshop we will look for a known *Command injection vulnerabilities* in [kohya_ss](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-019_GHSL-2024-024_kohya_ss/). Such vulnerabilities can occur when information that is controlled by a user makes its way to application code that insecurely constructs a command and executes it. The command insecurely constructed from user input can be rewritten to perform unintended actions such as arbitrary command execution, disclosure of sensitive information.

The command injections discussed in this workshop are [CVE-2024-32022, CVE-2024-32026, CVE-2024-32025, CVE-2024-32027](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-019_GHSL-2024-024_kohya_ss/).

## Theory

### Sources and sinks

Think about one of the most well-known vulnerabilities—command injection. It happens if user input is used in functions, that allow running commands in a shell directly on the servier. It allows an attacker to execute operating system (OS) commands on the server that is running an application, and typically fully compromise the application and its data.

The main cause of injection vulnerabilities is untrusted, user-controlled input being used in sensitive or dangerous functions of the program. To represent these in static analysis, we use terms such as data flow, sources, and sinks.

User input generally comes from entry points to an application—the origin of data. These include parameters in HTTP methods, such as GET and POST, or command line arguments to a program. These are called “**sources**.”

Continuing with our command injection, an example of a dangerous function that should not be called with unsanitized untrusted data could be `os.system`. These dangerous functions are called “**sinks**.” Note that just because a function is potentially dangerous, it does not mean it is immediately an exploitable vulnerability and has to be removed. Many sinks have ways of using them safely. Other exmaples of sinks, that shouldn't be used with user input are MySQLCursor.execute() from the MySQLdb library in Python (causing SQL injection) or Python’s eval() built-in function which evaluates arbitrary expressions (causing code injection).

For a vulnerability to be present, the unsafe, user-controlled input has to be used without proper sanitization or input validation in a dangerous function. In other words, there has to be a code path between the source and the sink, in which case we say that data flows from a source to a sink—there is a “**data flow**” from the source to the sink.

### CodeQL cheatsheet
The basic query structure
```codeql
import python

from <type> <name> 		//variables used in the query

where <conditions for variables>

select <output>			//results, referring to the variables
```

Find references to `os.system()` calls

```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs

from  API::CallNode call
where call = API::moduleImport("os")
  .getMember("system")
  .getACall()
select call, "Call to os.system"
```

Find references to `os.system()` calls, this time with a predicate

```codeql
predicate isOsSystemSink(API::CallNode call) {
	call = API::moduleImport("os")
	.getMember("system").getACall()
  }


from API::CallNode call
where isOsSystemSink(call)
select call, "Call to os.system"
```

Find references to `os.system()` calls, this time with a class

```codeql
class OsSystemSink extends API::CallNode {
  OsSystemSink() {
    this = API::moduleImport("os")
    .getMember("system").getACall()
	}
}


from API::CallNode call
where call instanceof OsSystemSink
select call, "Call to os.system"
```

Find references to `os.system()` calls, this time with a class.
Specify that the type we are starting with is `OsSystemSink`

```codeql
class OsSystemSink extends API::CallNode {
  OsSystemSink() {
    this = API::moduleImport("os")
    .getMember("system").getACall()
	}
}


from OsSystemSink s
select s, "Call to os.system"
```

## Workshop part I - test database

In this workshop we are going to find command injections, in which user input ends up in an `os.system` call.

In the first part of the workshop, we will write CodeQL queries to find sources and sinks, `os.system` calls, on an intentionally vulnerable codebase. In the second part of the workshop, we are going to use those queries to find a command injection from a source to a sink in an open source software, [kohya_ss](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss) v22.6.1.

With the CodeQL query we write, we will be able to find command injections like the one below.

The user input comes from an interactive Gradio (web framework for machine learning applications) component `gr.Textbox` at #1. `gr.Button.click` at #2 binds the button click to the execute_cmd function, passing in the values from `folder`. That means when the `gr.Button` is clicked `folder` is pased to `execute_cmd`, where `folder` is concatenated into a command, and executed on the system in an `os.system` call at #3.

```python
import gradio as gr
import os

def execute_cmd(folder):
    cmd = f"python caption.py --dir={folder}"
    os.system(cmd) #3


with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("Create caption files for images in a directory")
    with gr.Row():
        folder = gr.Textbox(placeholder="Directory to caption") #1
        logs = gr.Checkbox(label="Add verbose logs")

    btn = gr.Button("Run")
    btn.click(fn=execute_cmd, inputs=[folder]) #2


if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo.launch(debug=True)
```

You'll also notice another command injection example in the workshop, in an app created using the `Flask` framework. In this case, the user input comes from a GET parameter of a Flask (popular web framework in Python) request, which is stored in the variable `files` (see #1). `files` is then passed to the `os.system` call and concatenated with `ls`, leading to command injection (see #2).

```python
import os
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/command1")
def command_injection1():
    files = request.args.get('files', '')   #1
    os.system("ls " + files)                #2
```

We will start by gradually building a query to detect `os.system` calls and afterwards a query for sources.

### 1. Find all calls to functions from external libraries

We can find all calls to functions from external libraries (not defined in the codebase) by using CodeQL's `ApiGraphs` module.

Use the template below:
```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs

from 	//TODO: fill me in. Start typing `API::` and press `Ctrl+Space` to see a list of available types. Name your variable `call`
select 	//TODO: fill me in
```
Right click in the file area and choose "CodeQL: Run Query on Selected Database" to run the query.

<details>
<summary>Guidelines</summary>

- In the `from` clause, start by `API::` and press `Ctrl + Space` to see the types available in the API Graphs module.
- A call is represented by the `API::CallNode` type. Create a variable with that type and the name `call`.
- To limit results only to calls in the root folder of the application (called `test-app`) add a ` where` clause with the condtion `where call.getLocation().getFile().getRelativePath().regexpMatch("test-app/.*")`.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs

from API::CallNode call
where call.getLocation().getFile().getRelativePath().regexpMatch("test-app/.*")
select call, "A call"
```

</details>

### 2. Find all calls to `os.system`

<details>
<summary>Guidelines</summary>

- In the `from` clause, create a `call` variable of the `API::CallNode` type.
- In the `where` clause, use the equality operator `=` to assert that `call` is equal to the `os.system` calls. Use the logical operator `and` to specify several conditions.
- To find nodes corresponding to the `os` library, use the `API::moduleImport()` method with the `os` as the argument. To access the `system` function of the `os` library, use the `getMember()` predicate on `API::moduleImport()`. At last, get any `os.system` calls with the `getACall()` predicate.

Fill out the template:
```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs

from API::CallNode call
where call //TODO: fill me in
and
call.getLocation().getFile().getRelativePath().regexpMatch("test-app/.*")
select call, "Call to `os.system`"
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs

from API::CallNode call
where call = API::moduleImport("os").getMember("system").getACall() and
call.getLocation().getFile().getRelativePath().regexpMatch("test-app/.*")
select call, "Call to `os.system`"
```

</details>

### 3. Find the first arguments to calls to `os.system`
We want to find the first arguments to `os.system` calls, so later we can see if any user input flows into the first arguments (so into the command that will be executed).

<details>
<summary>Guidelines</summary>

- Fill out the template:
```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs

from API::CallNode call
where call = API::moduleImport("os").getMember("system").getACall() and
call.getLocation().getFile().getRelativePath().regexpMatch("test-app/.*")
select call // TODO: fill me in. Type a dot `.` right after `call` and press `Ctrl+Space` to see available predicates.
```


</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs

from API::CallNode call
where call = API::moduleImport("os").getMember("system").getACall() and
call.getLocation().getFile().getRelativePath().regexpMatch("test-app/.*")
select call.getArg(0), "First argument of an `os.system` call"
```

</details>

### 4. Tranform your query that finds the calls to `os.system` into a CodeQL class
`classes` in CodeQL can be used to encapsulate reusable portions of logic. Classes represent single sets of values, and they can also include operations (known as member predicates) specific to that set of values. You have already seen numerous instances of CodeQL classes (API::CallNode) and  member predicates (getLocation() etc.)

<details>
<summary>Guidelines</summary>

 - To create a new type, we have to extend a supertype, here `API::CallNode`, give it a name, and a _characteristic predicate_ with the same name. We'll name our class, `OsSystemSink`.

Fill out the template:
```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs

class OsSystemSink extends API::CallNode {
	OsSystemSink() {
		//TODO: fill me in
	}
}

from API::CallNode call
where // TODO: fill me in
and call.getLocation().getFile().getRelativePath().regexpMatch("test-app/.*")
select call.getArg(0), "Call to os.system"
```
- Use the magic `this` keyword, that refers to the instances of the call nodes (`API::CallNode`s) that we are describing in the class. Use `this` to find the calls to `os.system` in the same way you did previously with `API::moduleImport`.
- Change the `where` clause to make your `call` variable an `instanceof` your new `OsSystemSink` class.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs

class OsSystemSink extends API::CallNode {
	OsSystemSink() {
		this = API::moduleImport("os").getMember("system").getACall()
	}
}


from API::CallNode call
where call instanceof OsSystemSink
and call.getLocation().getFile().getRelativePath().regexpMatch("test-app/.*")
select call.getArg(0), "First argument of an `os.system` call"
```

</details>

### 5. Find all sources with the RemoteFlowSource class

Now we switch to finding sources.

Most sources are already modeled and in CodeQL, and have the `RemoteFlowSource` type. We can use the type to find any sources in a codebase.

<details>
<summary>Guidelines</summary>

- Import `semmle.python.dataflow.new.RemoteFlowSources` to use the RemoteFlowSource type.
- In the `from` clause, press `Ctrl + Space` to see all available types.

Fill out the template:
```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.dataflow.new.RemoteFlowSources

from //TODO: fill me in
where //TODO: fill me in
select //TODO: fill me in
```


</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```codeql
import python
import semmle.python.dataflow.new.RemoteFlowSources

from RemoteFlowSource rfs
where rfs.getLocation().getFile().getRelativePath().regexpMatch("test-app/.*")
select rfs
```

</details>

## Workshop part II - find command injections in kohya_ss

[Kohya_ss](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss) is a GUI for [Kohya's Stable Diffusion scripts for training, generation and utilities for Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts).

In the second part of the workshop, we are going to switch the codebase we are querying on to the `kohya_ss` one and find the data flows from sources to sinks in `kohya_ss`, which lead to command injections: [CVE-2024-32022, CVE-2024-32026, CVE-2024-32025, CVE-2024-32027](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-019_GHSL-2024-024_kohya_ss/)

Before you start with the next exercise:
- Go to the CodeQL tab in VSCode, `Databases` section, click on "Choose Database from Archive" and select the `kohya_ss-db.zip` file in the root of the repository. A checkmark should appear. This will select the CodeQL database you are working on.

### 6. Find data flows from sources to the first argument to `os.system` calls

<details>
<summary>Guidelines</summary>

- Use the template below and note:
- in the `isSource` predicate, refine the `source` variable to be of the `RemoteFlowSource` type.
- in the `isSink` predicate, refine the `sink` variable to be the first argument to an `os.system` call. Do it using the `exists` mechanism and your `OsSystemSink` class.
  - `exists` is a mechanism for introducing temporary variables with a restricted scope. You can think of them as their own from-where-select. In this case, use `exists` to introduce the variable `call` with type `OsSystemSink` and then refine `sink` to be the first argument to the `call`.

```codeql
/**
 * @name Command injection in os.system sink
 * @kind path-problem
 * @id codeql-ws/dataflow-query
 */

import python
import semmle.python.dataflow.new.DataFlow
import semmle.python.dataflow.new.TaintTracking
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs
import MyFlow::PathGraph
import semmle.python.dataflow.new.RemoteFlowSources

//TODO: add previous class definition here

private module MyConfig implements DataFlow::ConfigSig {
  predicate isSource(DataFlow::Node source) {
    // TODO: fill me in
  }

  predicate isSink(DataFlow::Node sink) {
    // TODO: fill me in. Use the `exists` mechanism
      exists(<type> <variable> |
      sink = ...
  )
  }
}

module MyFlow = TaintTracking::Global<MyConfig>;

from MyFlow::PathNode source, MyFlow::PathNode sink
where MyFlow::flowPath(source, sink)
select sink.getNode(), source, sink, "Command injection"
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```codeql
/**
 * @name Command injection in os.system sink
 * @kind path-problem
 * @id codeql-ws/dataflow-query
 */

import python
import semmle.python.dataflow.new.DataFlow
import semmle.python.dataflow.new.TaintTracking
import semmle.python.ApiGraphs
import semmle.python.dataflow.new.RemoteFlowSources
import MyFlow::PathGraph

class OsSystemSink extends API::CallNode {
	OsSystemSink() {
		this = API::moduleImport("os").getMember("system").getACall()
	}
}

private module MyConfig implements DataFlow::ConfigSig {
predicate isSource(DataFlow::Node source) {
	source instanceof RemoteFlowSource
}

predicate isSink(DataFlow::Node sink) {
	exists(OsSystemSink call |
	sink = call.getArg(0)
	)
}
}

module MyFlow = TaintTracking::Global<MyConfig>;

from MyFlow::PathNode source, MyFlow::PathNode sink
where MyFlow::flowPath(source, sink)
select sink.getNode(), source, sink, "Command injection"
```

</details>

## Bonus exercises, if time allows

### 7. Query the codebase with the default queries

CodeQL queries for Python reside in the `ql/python/ql/src/Security` folder. There already exist queries for the most popular vulnerabilities: SQL injection, command injection, code injection, etc. Run the SQL injection query (CWE-089) on the test database (you'll need to select it in the CodeQL extension > Databases. Note the checkmark).

:bulb: This is very interesting for security researchers - using the default queries, we can get a general idea of what the potential vulnerabilities might exist in a given project.


### 8. Run your own queries using multi-repository variant analysis (MRVA)

The power of CodeQL lies in being able to reuse the CodeQL queries and models to run them on any codebase in the same language. We can run CodeQL queries on up to a 1000 repositories at once using multi-repository variant analysis (MRVA). The projects have to be hosted on GitHub.

:bulb: This is very interesting for security researchers - if you've found a potential dangerous sink or a source, you can add it to CodeQL (or run as a query) and do your research against a thousand repositories at once.



- Follow the setup in the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-for-vs-code/getting-started-with-codeql-for-vs-code/running-codeql-queries-at-scale-with-multi-repository-variant-analysis).
- Note that MRVA runs using GitHub actions workflows. Actions workflows are free on public repositories, and paid on privates ones.
- After the setup, right-click and choose "CodeQL: Run Variant Analysis"
